        <p>
            Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, also known as the "Missile Man of India," was one of the most respected scientists and the 11th President of India (2002‚Äì2007).
             Born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background but rose to become a symbol of dedication, knowledge, and service to the nation.
Kalam played a crucial role in India's missile development program and contributed significantly to the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. He worked with DRDO and ISRO, where he was
 instrumental in projects like Agni and Prithvi missiles.
Despite his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was deeply connected with the youth. He believed in the power of dreams,
 education, and hard work. He authored many inspiring books, including "Wings of Fire", "Ignited Minds", and "India 2020".
Known for his humility, vision, and love for students, he continued to teach and motivate young minds until his last
 breath. He passed away on 27 July 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong‚Äîtruly dying while doing what he loved most: teaching.
üïäÔ∏è His life remains a guiding light for millions, reminding us that with courage and determination, anything is possible.
